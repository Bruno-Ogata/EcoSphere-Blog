# EcoSphere-Blog
A blog with a theme of ecology and sustainability developed during the Capstone project 3 of the bootcamp of fullstack web development powered by Dr. Angela Yu at Udemy. On this project I used my habilities aquired in Express, Node, Embedded JS and Git and version control. Also used previous knowledge in CSS, JavaScript and HTML.

To run this application you might open the code on an IDE of your preference and execute those commands:

npm install

node index.js 

With this you will be able to run the application locally on port 3000. so you can go on your browser and put this url: http://localhost:3000/
